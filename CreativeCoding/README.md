Download and install IDE (ie XCode) as needed as well as the latest OF.

Code Assignments:

1. Create an easing "cheat sheet" to show various types of easing animations.

2. Create composition using easing and/or zeno to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Try to make it smooth, elegant and organic. Make a gif of your results.
