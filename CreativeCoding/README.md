# Creative Coding Fall 2018

### Week 2: Trigonometry

Code Assignments:

1. Create an animation that uses oscillations, angles, rotations and/or tweens. It may be 2d or 3d. Add a gui to adjust certain parameters. Make a gif

2. Review the OOP reading and create a sketch that makes a custom class that is a "creature" that can follow the mouse and rotates correctly in the direction it moves. Give your creatures some personality. See if you can make multiples that follow at different speeds.

### Week 1: Animation Review, Easing

Read: [OF Book: How OF Works](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)

Read: [OF Book: Animation](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html) (up to "Function based movement)

Download and install IDE (ie XCode) as needed as well as the latest OF.

Code Assignments:

1. Create an easing "cheat sheet" to show various types of easing animations.

2. Create composition using easing and/or zeno to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Try to make it smooth, elegant and organic. Make a gif of your results.
