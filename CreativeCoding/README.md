# Creative Coding Fall 2018

### Week 9: Pixels and Computer Vision

Code Assignments:

1. Use a computer vision library (ofxOpenCV or ofxCV) and possibly ofxBox2d to create your own version of one of these existing artworks:

You do not have to reproduce the work exactly but build on the idea in your own way.

2. Research several potential topics to explore for a final project and be prepared to discuss them after the break. Your final project should address a topic in the world of creative coding and should have a concept statement. You may propose works that use other platfroms besides Openframeworks such as : Unity (must involve scripting), javascript (p5.js, ml5.js etc.)

### Week 8: Sound

Code Assignments:

1. Create a sound toy - an interactive experiment that creates a soundscape (collisions, animations, velocities might trigger sound effects to create a unique musical experience).

### Week 7: 3d

Code Assignments:

1. Create a 3d scene with and ofCamera that you can move with keypresses. Create one mode where the camrea animates to preset positions.

2. Create your own sound reactive 3d world using just volume levels.

### Week 6: Midterms

### Week 5: Review

Finish Midterms projects!

### Week 4: Noise

Code Assignments:

1. Modify any sketch you have done so far to incorporate noise into some element.

2. Create a scribble tool that lets you draw lines but adds a bit of noise to the line as you draw. 

3. Begin work on your midterm (if you have not already!)  and bring your progrress to class.

### Week 3: Forces, Velocity

Code Assignments:

Create 2 compositions using particles with forces, attraction and repulsion. Play with other shapes besides circles and try to incorporate rotation in the direction of movement. Make one composition that uses an image in some way (as a background for example).

### Week 2: Trigonometry

Code Assignments:

1. Create an animation that uses oscillations, angles, rotations and/or tweens. It may be 2d or 3d. Add a gui to adjust certain parameters. Make a gif

2. Review the OOP reading and create a sketch that makes a custom class that is a "creature" that can follow the mouse and rotates correctly in the direction it moves. Give your creatures some personality. See if you can make multiples that follow at different speeds.

### Week 1: Animation Review, Easing

Read: [OF Book: How OF Works](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)

Read: [OF Book: Animation](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html) (up to "Function based movement)

Download and install IDE (ie XCode) as needed as well as the latest OF.

Code Assignments:

1. Create an easing "cheat sheet" to show various types of easing animations.

2. Create composition using easing and/or zeno to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Try to make it smooth, elegant and organic. Make a gif of your results.
