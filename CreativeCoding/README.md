# Creative Coding Fall 2018

### Week 5: Review

Finish Midterms projects!

### Week 4: Noise

Code Assignments:

1. Modify any sketch you have done so far to incorporate noise into some element.

2. Create a scribble tool that lets you draw lines but adds a bit of noise to the line as you draw. 

3. Begin work on your midterm (if you have not already!)  and bring your progrress to class.

### Week 3: Forces, Velocity

Code Assignments:

Create 2 compositions using particles with forces, attraction and repulsion. Play with other shapes besides circles and try to incorporate rotation in the direction of movement. Make one composition that uses an image in some way (as a background for example).

### Week 2: Trigonometry

Code Assignments:

1. Create an animation that uses oscillations, angles, rotations and/or tweens. It may be 2d or 3d. Add a gui to adjust certain parameters. Make a gif

2. Review the OOP reading and create a sketch that makes a custom class that is a "creature" that can follow the mouse and rotates correctly in the direction it moves. Give your creatures some personality. See if you can make multiples that follow at different speeds.

### Week 1: Animation Review, Easing

Read: [OF Book: How OF Works](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)

Read: [OF Book: Animation](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html) (up to "Function based movement)

Download and install IDE (ie XCode) as needed as well as the latest OF.

Code Assignments:

1. Create an easing "cheat sheet" to show various types of easing animations.

2. Create composition using easing and/or zeno to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Try to make it smooth, elegant and organic. Make a gif of your results.
